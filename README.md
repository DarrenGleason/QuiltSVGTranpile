# QuiltSVGTranpile

A transpiler that converts QUILT language into SVG files.  Part of a project for CSCI 450 at Colorado Mesa University.

Using documentation from http://www.cs.bsu.edu/homepages/dmz/cs335/ppt/chapter8/chapter8.ppt 
Which summarizes Chapter 8 of Programming Languages by Ravi Sethi.

And uses SVG's ability to group, rotate and translate to perform turn and sew.
The A and B primitives are defined as <img src="ExampleAB.svg"/>

This is a Test from Darren, to see if it works.
